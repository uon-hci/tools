$$

#### Standard Deviation (SD)

> Perfect description of an entire distribution

$$
S = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x - \bar{x})^2}{N - 1}}
$$

#### Z scores

> Used to perform calculations on normally distributed data
> A **Z score** is the distance from the mean measured in units of Standard Deviation

$$
Z = \frac{x - \bar{x}}{SD}
$$

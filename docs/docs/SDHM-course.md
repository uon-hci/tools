# Simulation and Digital Human modeling

**COURSE**

## 1. Introduction: Simulation

**Simulation** is *giving a false impression of..*, *reproducing the conditions of..* or *looking and acting like..*.
In modern life it is the science of *make-believe*, *artificial* and *virtual* constructions.

### Dimensions

It has three different **dimensions**:

- *Live*: Real people using simulated machines in real environment,
- *Virtual*: Real people using simulated machines in simulated environment,
- *Constructive*: Simulated people using simulated machine in simulated environment.

### Areas and Industries

In modern life, simulation is involved in 5 key application areas:

- *Training and education*,
- *Design*,
- *Entertainement*,
- *Criminal investigations*,
- *Research*.

As well as 7 key industries:

- *Transport*,
- *Media*,
- *Defense*,
- *Emergency services*,
- *Healthcare*,
- *Manufacturing*,
- *Energy*.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

The advantages of simulation are:

- *Resource savings*: reduced need for real objects, quicker development time, it's not the "real" thing,
- *Utility*: trying and experimenting easily, target specific user groups, repeat exercises, assess performances easily, maintain control over variables, investigate
issues hard to come by in the real world,
- *Safety*: reduced potential harm, consider extreme issues (a plane crash), good for novice users.

The disadvantages of simulation are:

- *Validity*: potential failure to reflect real-world performance/behaviour,
- *Sickness*: people getting sick in the simulator,
- *Costs*: start-up, maintenance,
- *Software*: difficult to use/learn.

## 2. Sickness in Simulators

### Symptoms of sickness

Symptoms of sickness during a simulation can be:

- *Eye strain*,
- *Headache*,
- *Diziness*
- *Sweating*,
- *Disorientation*,
- *Drowsiness/Fatigue*,
- *Vertigo*,
- *Pallor*,
- *Nausea*,
- *Vomiting*.

### Importance in understanding sickness

Understanding sickness in a simulator is very important for the following reasons:

- *Ethics*: subject participants to discomfort,
- *Representativeness of the sample*: defining who can/can't use/participate in the simulator and/or the product,
- *Negative transfer of training*: sickness implies difficult teaching/learning conditions,
- *Validity of results*: sick participants can interfere with practical performance results,
- *Design*: a simulator that makes most people sick needs to be redesigned (so is the product).

### Sensor Conflict Theory

During a simulator session, three major spatial senses are challenged:

- the *Visual System*,
- the *Vestibular System*,
- the *Non-Vestibular System*.

If these senses are conflicted, sickness is bound to appear. There are two types of
conflict:

- *Visual-inertial*: conflict between the Visual System and the Vestibular/Non-Vestibular System,
- *Canal-otolith*: conflict within the Vestibular System.

For most simulations, the **Visual-inertial** conflict is the main consideration.

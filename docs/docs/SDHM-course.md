# Simulation and Digital Human modeling

**COURSE**

---

## 1. Introduction: Simulation

**Simulation** is *giving a false impression of..*, *reproducing the conditions of..* or *looking and acting like..*.
In modern life it is the science of *make-believe*, *artificial* and *virtual* constructions.

### Dimensions

It has three different **dimensions**:

- *Live*: Real people using simulated machines in real environment,
- *Virtual*: Real people using simulated machines in simulated environment,
- *Constructive*: Simulated people using simulated machine in simulated environment.

### Areas and Industries

In modern life, simulation is involved in 5 key application areas:

- *Training and education*,
- *Design*,
- *Entertainement*,
- *Criminal investigations*,
- *Research*.

As well as 7 key industries:

- *Transport*,
- *Media*,
- *Defense*,
- *Emergency services*,
- *Healthcare*,
- *Manufacturing*,
- *Energy*.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

The advantages of simulation are:

- *Resource savings*: reduced need for real objects, quicker development time, it's not the "real" thing,
- *Utility*: trying and experimenting easily, target specific user groups, repeat exercises, assess performances easily, maintain control over variables, investigate
issues hard to come by in the real world,
- *Safety*: reduced potential harm, consider extreme issues (a plane crash), good for novice users.

The disadvantages of simulation are:

- *Validity*: potential failure to reflect real-world performance/behaviour,
- *Sickness*: people getting sick in the simulator,
- *Costs*: start-up, maintenance,
- *Software*: difficult to use/learn.

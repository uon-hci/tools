# Studying Human Performance

**COURSE**

---

## Introduction

> **Ergonomics** is the scientific discipline cocerned with the understanding of interactions among humans and other elements of a system, in order to optimise human well-being and overall system performance.

The aim of this course is to be able to **analyse products and workplaces** using a range of different methods, to **compare and contrast different methodological approaches**, to **evaluate methods** and statistical techniques, to **demonstrate the applicatio of specific methods** in practical contexts ; in order to solve Human Factors-related problems.

## Methods

The understanding of methods is the core matter of this subject. A method is a "*way of proceeding or doing something*", and in Human Factors, allow for the collection of data. Methods need to be **clear**, **structured** and **repeatable**.

The **context** of the studies in which methods are used define purposes, roles and data that make up for many different methods. It is hence very important to understand the context of these studies, and how it impacts the use of methods.

### Study types

Three study types are observed: **Laboratory**, **Simulation** and **Field**. These types can be compared with the following table:

|               | Laboratory/Simulation | Field 
| ------------- | ------------- |  -------
| Advantages    | More control  | Real task
| Disadvantages | Limited scope and accuracy  | Unplanned events (danger, interruptions)

### Affecting factors

In addition to the study type, there are numerous factors affecting the choice of methods:

- Amount of participants,
- Motivation (*research*, *consultancy*),
- Location,
- Objective,
- Types of desired results,
- Stakeholders, sponsors and funders.

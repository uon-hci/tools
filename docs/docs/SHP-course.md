# Studying Human Performance

**COURSE**

---

## Introduction

> **Ergonomics** is the scientific discipline cocerned with the understanding of interactions among humans and other elements of a system, in order to optimise human well-being and overall system performance.

The aim of this course is to be able to **analyse products and workplaces** using a range of different methods, to **compare and contrast different methodological approaches**, to **evaluate methods** and statistical techniques, to **demonstrate the applicatio of specific methods** in practical contexts ; in order to solve Human Factors-related problems.

## Choosing methods

The understanding of methods is the core matter of this subject. A method is a "*way of proceeding or doing something*", and in Human Factors, allow for the collection of data. Methods need to be **clear**, **structured** and **repeatable**.

The **context** of the studies in which methods are used define purposes, roles and data that make up for many different methods. It is hence very important to understand the context of these studies, and how it impacts the use of methods.

### Study types

Three study types are observed: **Laboratory**, **Simulation** and **Field**. These types are compared with the following table:

|               | Laboratory/Simulation | Field 
| ------------- | ------------- |  -------
| Advantages    | More control  | Real task
| Disadvantages | Limited scope and accuracy  | Unplanned events (danger, interruptions)

### Affecting factors

In addition to the study type, there are numerous factors affecting the choice of methods:

- Amount of participants,
- Motivation (*research*, *consultancy*),
- Location,
- Objective,
- Types of desired results,
- Stakeholders, sponsors and funders.

### *Good* methods

The choice of a method significantly depends on the context of the study. However it doesn't define the quality of a method. *What is a good method?*
**Five requirements** define the quality of a method:

- **Validity**: does the method measure what it is supposed to measure?
- **Reliability**: is the method stable? (consistent over various measurements, between/within researchers),
- **Sensitivity**: is the method able to detect effects of interest? (the more sensible the more accurate),
- **Usability**: is the method easy to learn and implement?
- **Resources**: how expensive and demanding (cost, expertise) is the method? 

### Types of measure

When doing a study, the type of measures defines the methods used and the data collected. In most ergonomics works, the following measure types are assessed:

- **Performance**: Task achivement, errors,
- **Demands**: Task time, physical and mental workload,
- **Behaviour**: Body movements,
- **Knowledge**: Subjective responses to a *test* situation,
- **Opinions**: Ratings, preferences.

### Method types

A simple classification splits all available methods into **three categories**:

- Observation,
- Self report,
- Use of archival data.

For all methods, the **type of output** and **validity** are also differentiated. There is first the matter of **objective** or **subjective** validity:

- **Objective**: clamining the describe a true and correct reality, independent of those involved in the research process,
- **Subjective**: based on data derived from observations of events as they occur, or from interviews.

Finally, the data can be split in two categories:

- **Qualitative**: data classification of objects based on attributes and properties,
- **Quantitative**: data measuread and expressed numerically.

## Planning and designing studies

### Defining the problem, aim and hypotheses

The first step in designing a study is to clearly define the problem and issues that require investigation, and what will
be achived by doing it. This is usually represented by a system of **hypotheses**, or *statements of the predicted outcome*. As 
studies manipulate variables and data, the aim of these hypotheses is to predict, understand and validate the relationships between said variables.
Conventionally, there are two types of hypothesis:

- **Experimental**, or *H1*, that predicts a dependent relationship between variables,
- **Null**, or *H0*, that states that variables are not dependent (one does not impact the other).

### Identify the research variables

The said varaibles are split in three categories:

- **Independant variables** (*IV*): variables manipulated by the experimented, related to the individual, task, system or environment,
- **Dependant varaibles** (*DV*): varaibles being measured in the experiment, not under the control of the experimenter, possibly affected by the IVs,
- **Controlled variables**: variables that need to be kept constant during the experiment.

### Choose the research setting

# Design Ethnography

**COURSE**

--- 

## Introduction

> Design ethnography is about ***understanding people*** in a sociological perspective.

Ethnography comes from the greek *ethnos* (people) and *grapho* (study). It dates back to the 18th century (colonialism) as the study of people who
lived in faraway places (initially tribal societies) to understand them. The **social order** is a major concern in ethnography studies to
understand the character of everyday life. 

This course focuses on the empircal aspect of ethnography: the **fieldwork**. It is the immersion in the field to 
observe and study but not only from the perspective of an outsider, but from *within the midst* of everyday life.
Also called *mucking-in*, the goal is to develop an appreciation of people as they really are and apprehend the ordinariness of life.

Design Ethnography is relevant to design through computer systems, applications and services that are now embedded in socially organised activities. 
This social organisation is taken for granted (the mundane interactions: *buying a coffee*, *taking the bus*, *cooking dinner*). 
To understand how everyday life gets done, **Ethnomethodology** is used: it is not a research method, but an **analytic orientation**.

The course is outlined with the following chapters:

- **The focus of fieldwork**
- **Doing fieldwork**
- **Analytic orientaton to the field**
- **Analysing interactional order**
- **Representing interactional order**
- **Assumptions testing**
- **Informing design**

## The focus of fieldwork

Ethnometodology is not a method, instead this course focuses on the members's methods used to conduct and organise the social activities, they are called the **interactional methods**.
To describe and understands these methods, the empirical approach of this course requires to collect **ethnographic data**, or fieldwork data. This data is usually photos, videos, audio recordings
or digital prints. Using all this data to give sense to the social order of an activity is also called presenting a **praxeological account**.

In addition to interactional methods, humans make use of a repertoire of **interactional resources** to achieve social order. These resources are tools, not only
drawned from the resource of speech but also from **bodily conduct**: gaze, body orientation, body motion, gesture.

## Doing fieldwork

For any type of activity, doing fieldwork involves choosing the correct tools and resources to collect data, analyse the member's interactional methods
and assemble an **ethnographic record**.

Doing fielwork can be split in three parts:

- **Immersion**: witnessing first hand what and how interactions are made (accounts of *in and of*),
- **Documentation**: recording, transcribing and describing actions and interactions,
- **Examination**: identifying what and how interactions are made, providing accounts.

### Tools and resources

Conducting fieldwork can be achieved with the following tools and resources:

- **Notes**: writing down observations, thoughts and reflections, snippets of conservations, etc. While observing the activity, it is important
to look out for the following details:
    - *Ecology*: where the action takes place, layout of the space, location of actors and roles, equipments and artefacts used,
    - *Formal organisation*: plans or procedures,
    - *Transitions events*: important transition moments (arriving, leaving, etc),
    - *Arrangements of collaboration*: interactions between members (who talks to whom about what),
    - *Audio-visual data indexing*: times, sequence, making sense of digital data.
- **Interviews**: contextual interviews (not scripted), conversations about the the action conducted while observing it being done,
- **Aduio-visual recordings**: video cameras, audio recorders, still photography.
- **Digital logs**: messages, social media, conversations, systems, etc.

### Activity map

An activity map is an overview of the phases and activites comprising the activity, it is an index into the 
ethnographic record of materials to show how each is done in detail. This slicing map the connection between activities,
the sequential order, where the action starts, ends, with what, etc.

### *In and of* interaction

While collecting data and mapping the conduct of an activity answers the question *What?*, a more thorough work
regarding the *How?* must be done. The accounts of *in and of* interaction goes beyond the mere description of what is done,
but addresses the interactional resources, how digital and physical resources are used, how decisions are made: the aim
is to understand what is done *in the doing*, the members' methods.

When studying activities in organisations, it is important to develop an appreciation of **working knowledge**. This addresses 
how abstractions are put into practice (plans, procedures, rules, routines, etc) and goes beyond abstract descriptions of method. If one
can declare the ability to reproduce an activity **in practice**, that individual is said to have developed a **vulgar competence**.

### Vulgar competence

The **vulgar competence** is an ordinary expertise to understand the ordinary things that people know to do any *routine* or *procedure*
happen again. It is about recognising what is heard and seen by members of the setting studied, knowing what members' expertise consists of in action.
It is about knowing what the members know and describe its methodical character by focusing on their **accounts**.
Members' accounts are the particular things they **say**, **do** and the particular way they use **resources**. It makes what is being done and how it
is organised **observable-and-reportable**.

### Machinery of interaction

The member's accounts provide an **accountable interactional order**, revealing the **machinery of interaction** that addresses the taken for granted orderliness of a familiair world. The aim is to transform the simple view of what happened from a matter of particular interaction done by particular people, to a matter of interactions as products of a machinery.
This accountable order of interactional work is not person specific, the machinery is the generalisable features of the interaction.

## Analytic orientation to the field

### The taken-for-granted orderliness of everyday life

When doing analysis of an activity, one must *ignore* the feeling of normality and obviousness of an social interaction. By finding a scene unremarkable and not worth of analysis, it becomes difficult to notice the accounts (bodily, verbal and artefactual) involved. Analysts must treat everything as **anthropologically strange**, something they are not familiar with, as if they came from another planet and discovered earth and its inhabitants for the first time, trying to understand everything they say and do. They must proceed with indifference and ignore personal assumptions.

### Finding the machinery of interaction

Finding the **acountable interactional order** and hence uncovering the **machinery of interaction** can be done with the following steps:

1. **What is being done?**: Slice, define, filter and find the order of the accounts as well as their nature (verbal, embodied or artefactual), 
2. **How is it done?**: Elaborate the accounts by describing how what is done is being done, 
3. **Machinery**: Extract a distinctive set of methods for assembling the accounts, that describe

## Interaction analysis

There are specific **features of interaction** that help unpacking member's methods:

- **Sequentiality**
- **Temporal organisation**
- **Participation structures**
- **Trouble and repair**
- **Spatial organisation**
- **Tools, artificats and documents**.

### FOCI

#### Sequentiality

Sequentiality addresses the context of an interaction, by finding its beginnings, middles and endings. It describes
how the interaction is occasioned, or avoided. The goal is to understand how the members recognise and maintain the different phases, 
how they reach the boundaries or how the transition are managed. The sequentiality can be represented with an activity map.

#### Temporal organisation

The temportal orderliness is about orienting the activity to time-tables, deadlines, schedules, calendars, etc. By defining
the routines, rythms, repetitions and periodicity of an activity, it is possible to look for the expected and the unexpected, and 
observe how it is dealt with.

#### Participation structures

The participation structures address the extent to which members share a common task orientation and attentional focus. The main 
aspects in this notion are how do members achieve and maintain a common understanding (embodied interactional resources, i.e *pointing*, *eye-contact*), 
and the technological resources used to achieve said collaboration.

#### Trouble and repair

Trouble defines the notion of a routine feature that occurs frequently, and that although can be subtle, potentially causes misunderstanding if not repaired.
Repairing is done through clarifying, repeating, rephrasing, pointing, demonstrating, etc.

#### Spatial organisation

The spatial organisation of an activity concerns how the members, resources, tools, artificats and documents are distributed in space.
In a social activity, members are co-oriented in space, based on the social norms: *personal space*, *public spaces* or *private spaces*.
The spatial configuration of a setting may constrain or enable certain interactions, and elements might get moved around. It is aslo important
to address the work involved in preparing the activity, or putting back the setting to its original organisation.

#### Tools, artifacts and documents

Resources employed in the interaction, both physical and digital are useful to analyse social organisation. Documents
can be used as ordering devices (.i.e *shopping list*). Collaborative documents can often be indexical to interaction and demonstrative to how they were produced.

### Conversation analysis

Conversation analysis seeks to describe the underlying social organization through which orderly and intelligible social interaction is made possible.

#### Adjency pairs

Talk tends to occur in responsive pairs; however, the pairs may be split over a sequence of turns. Two different speakers, in adjacent positions, are arranged in terms of *first*
and *second* **pair part**. Examples can be Question/Answer, Greeting/Response, Invitation/Acceptance-Refusal, Offering/Taking.
While adjencent pairing was brought in the context of talk analysis, it is actually the building block of many forms of modalities of interaction. Not only talk,
but embodied interaction, physical interaction and digital interaction are of importance in adjacent pairs.
Adjacent pairing helps to l
ocate the procedural ways in which the work of the setting is ordered.

#### Turn taking

Turn taking is an interactional exchange system, used for the ordering of many activities. It addresses embodied resources that members employ
to take turn in interaction, such as **verbal** (talk, intonation, tone, pitch, pacing) and **non-verbal** (gaze, glance, bodily orientation, gestures, pointing) or the use of artefacts.
So how do members know when it's their turn? Turn-taking is plit in two components:

- **Turn-Constructional Units** (TCUs): phrases, sentences, clauses, etc,
- **Turn allocation**: occurs at transitions through **speaker-selection** or **self-selection**.

If the current speaker stops or pauses, these behaviors can occur:

- if the current speaker nominates the next speaker, the latter has to right and is obliged to speak,
- if the current speaker doesn't nominate the next speaker, other speakers may self-select, or the current speaker can continue.

## Representing interactional order

Representing interactional order consists of:

1. Representing the sequential organisation in an **activity map**
    - This represents the phases and activities, **WHAT** is done, also called *accounts about interaction*
2. Unpacking the world in and through **praxeological accounts**
    - This represents **HOW** it is done, also called *accounts in and of interaction*,
    - **Praxeological accounts** = **Vivid exhibits** + **Thick description**
    - **Vivid exhibits**: photos, sequences of images, transcripts,
    - **Thick description**: higlighting the member's methods implicated in the production and recognition of accounts in and of interaction
3. Assembling the collection of **members' methods** to describe the **machinery of interaction**

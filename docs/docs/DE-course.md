# Design Ethnography

**COURSE**

--- 

## Introduction

> Design ethnography is about ***understanding people*** in a sociological perspective.

Ethnography comes from the greek *ethnos* (people) and *grapho* (study). It dates back to the 18th century (colonialism) as the study of people who
lived in faraway places (initially tribal societies) to understand them. The **social order** is a major concern in ethnography studies to
understand the character of everyday life. 

This course focuses on the empircal aspect of ethnography: the **fieldwork**. It is the immersion in the field to 
observe and study but not only from the perspective of an outsider, but from *within the midst* of everyday life.
Also called *mucking-in*, the goal is to develop an appreciation of people as they really are and apprehend the ordinariness of life.

Design Ethnography is relevant to design through computer systems, applications and services that are now embedded in socially organised activities. 
This social organisation is taken for granted (the mundane interactions: *buying a coffee*, *taking the bus*, *cooking dinner*). 
To understand how everyday life gets done, **Ethnomethodology** is used: it is not a research method, but an **analytic orientation**.

The course is outlined with the following chapters:

- **The focus of fieldwork**
- **Doing fieldwork**
- **Analytic orientaton to the field**
- **Analysing interactional order**
- **Representing interactional order**
- **Assumptions testing**
- **Informing design**

## The focus of fieldwork

Ethnometodology is not a method, instead this course focuses on the members's methods used to conduct and organise the social activities, they are called the **interactional methods**.
To describe and understands these methods, the empirical approach of this course requires to collect **ethnographic data**, or fieldwork data. This data is usually photos, videos, audio recordings
or digital prints. Using all this data to give sense to the social order of an activity is also called presenting a **praxeological account**.

In addition to interactional methods, humans make use of a repertoire of **interactional resources** to achieve social order. These resources are tools, not only
drawned from the resource of speech but also from **bodily conduct**: gaze, body orientation, body motion, gesture.

## Doing fieldwork

For any type of activity, doing fieldwork involves choosing the correct tools and resources to collect data, analyse the member's interactional methods
and assemble an **ethnographic record**.

Doing fielwork can be split in three parts:

- **Immersion**: witnessing first hand what and how interactions are made (accounts of *in and of*),
- **Documentation**: recording, transcribing and describing actions and interactions,
- **Examination**: identifying what and how interactions are made, providing accounts.

### Tools an resources

Conducting fieldwork can be achieved with the following tools and resources:

- **Notes**: writing down observations, thoughts and reflections, snippets of conservations, etc. While observing the activity, it is important
to look out for the following details:
    - *Ecology*: where the action takes place, layout of the space, location of actors and roles, equipments and artefacts used,
    - *Formal organisation*: plans or procedures,
    - *Transitions events*: important transition moments (arriving, leaving, etc),
    - *Arrangements of collaboration*: interactions between members (who talks to whom about what),
    - *Audio-visual data indexing*: times, sequence, making sense of digital data.
- **Interviews**: contextual interviews (not scripted), conversations about the the action conducted while observing it being done,
- **Aduio-visual recordings**: video cameras, audio recorders, still photography.
- **Digital logs**: messages, social media, conversations, systems, etc.

### Activity map

An activity map is an overview of the phases and activites comprising the activity, it is an index into the 
ethnographic record of materials to show how each is done in detail. This slicing map the connection between activities,
the sequential order, where the action starts, ends, with what, etc.

### *In and of* interaction

While collecting data and mapping the conduct of an activity answers the question *What?*, a more thorough work
regarding the *How?* must be done. The accounts of *in and of* interaction goes beyond the mere description of what is done,
but addresses the interactional resources, how digital and physical resources are used, how decisions are made: the aim
is to understand what is done *in the doing*, the members' methods.

When studying activities in organisations, it is important to develop an appreciation of **working knowledge**. This adresses 
how abstractions are put into practice (plans, procedures, rules, routines, etc) and goes beyond abstract descriptions of method.

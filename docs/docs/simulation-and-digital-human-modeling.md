> Chosen subjects:
>
> - Motorcycle manufacturer (simple seat moving right/left + screen to have longer tests ; we don't really want driving
experience fidelity, we are interested in a reliable system, providing a decent simulation (just a screen) with minimum sickness effects.
We want the testers to be able to stay on the fake bike for a long time to test the comfort)
> - University research department (fire escape, a total physical fidelity, we can have a large space with "moving walls" possibility (just
wood walls system) that can represent any space. Of course if a building is very large or with multiple floors, different sessions with sub-section
of the building can be recreated).

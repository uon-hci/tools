> - Motorcycle manufacturer (simple seat moving right/left + screen to have longer tests ; we don't really want driving
experience fidelity, we are interested in a reliable system, providing a decent simulation (just a screen) with minimum sickness effects.
We want the testers to be able to stay on the fake bike for a long time to test the comfort. The fake bike would be composed of three
key elements: the seat, the handlebar and footplate/gears, all those can be configured to different positions depending on the bike model being simulated).
> - Aviation museum (we want more aspect focused on physical aspects of the historical spitfire plane, a physical fidelity, while giving an
entertaining and educational flight experience with minimum SICKNESS (lots of people in museum, sample is large, young, old, fragile..etc) so
no motion, only visual).

- **Objective**: Improving sports motorbikes physical comfort with the use of a simulator.
- **What defines a comfortable motorbike?**: A motorbike that, during and after a prolonged use, does not lead to any form of physical pain or discomfort,
and does not affect the general well being of the rider in ways such as chronic pain, back distortion, muscular cramp and many more.
- **What is the population targeted?**: Accustomed motorbike riders, familiar with the notion of comfort and discomfort on a bike, capable of judging
accordingly to experience in short, medium and long trips with a motorbike as well as general knowledge and interest in the type of motorbike being tested.
- **What parts of the bike affect comfort?**: The main part of the bike responsible for comfort or discomfort is the seat. The human body is not made for staying still
on the same part of the body for prolonged periods of time. Because of decreased supply of blood to the skin, the area that is being compressed for a long time starts
to ache (comparison to sub-consciously turn over while sleeping). This principle implies that for a rider to feel comfortable on a motorbike for a long period of time,
he needs to be able to move and change positions on the seat. That includes moving forward, backward, widening the legs opening, relieving the weight by pressing the tank..etc.
For example, a seat angled forward will push the rider into the lowest spot, always putting pressure on the same parts of his body. Similarly, a seat too soft will
seem comfortable at first, but with longer trips the rider might pressure through and hit the plastic base pan of the bike. In addition, the position and size of both the
handlebar and the footplate/gears can also affect the rider's comfort. Of course, comfort and discomfort vary a lot from a rider to another one. Weight, size, general morphology, posture and habits will also influence his experience of comfort on a motorbike. Finally, the impact of the vibrations, the road quality, the speed and forces implied
in a motorbike experience is significant.
- **What are the relevant aspects for a simulator to achieve comfort evaluation?**: If the primary objective is to test the comfort of a bike, the main goal of
the simulator is to present the physical configuration of the motorbike being tested (seat, handlebar position, footplate/gears position) with a virtual
riding experience entertaining enough to allow the participant to stay on the bike for a prolonged period of time. That entertaining riding experience
does not need to have a high fidelity to the real-world riding, as the goal is only to test the physical comfort of the motorbike. There are no transfer
of training to teach how to ride, or to improve skills, but only a test on the impact of the motorbike on the participant's physical comfort. However,
that entertaining-enough riding experience, to last a longer period of time, needs to present minimum sickness effects. In addition, the physical
configuration of the motorbike needs to present a very import aspect of riding: the leaning motion. Even with fidelity not being the principal goal,
a leaning mechanism is absolutely necessary for any real-world rider to have a minimal enjoying and replicating experience of a real motorbike. Finally, the leaning motion
influences the position of the rider on the motorbike, which influences his comfort. Expecting a rider to test a seat with a motorbike constantly remaining in a straight line
would be a complete lack of validity.

<!-- - **Resources: is it gonna improve manufacturing and design? does it have to be the complete bike? Or just the elements responsible for comfort/discomfort?**
- **Utility: can the experiment be easily targeted? repeated? can the variables (seat, handlebar configuration..etc) be controlled easily?**
- **Validity: is the simulator providing the same scenario of comfort/discomfort? does the rider sits like on a real bike? is his posture the same?**
- **Sickness: what degree of fidelity is good enough for entertaining and prevent sickness(longer experiment)?**
- **Costs: is the simulator easily maintained? can it be used and configured for any motorbike model?**
- **Software: how does the graphics influence the prolonged experience? is the software hard to develop? screen or VR for leaning motion?**
- **What are the advantages?**
- **What are the disadvantages?** -->

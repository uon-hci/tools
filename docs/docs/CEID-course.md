# Cognitive Ergonomics in Design

**COURSE**

---

## Introduction

> The origins of ergonomics relate to ***fitting the task to the person***

Cognitive ergonomics is about considering the impact of how people think, reason, understand
and act in design of all aspects of life, and use it to make better decisions when creating products.

Taking cognitive factors into account can prevent incidents and errors in systems. The example 
of the [**Three Mile Island**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident) incident demontrastes the important of human factors.
In march 1979, bad design and bad user interfaces lead to human errors and then a nuclear incident. It was the most significant accident in
the U.S commercial nuclear power plant history (see chapter **Human error and automation** for more details).

The course is outlined with the following chapters:

- **Memory and attention**
- **Human workload**
- **Situation awareness**
- **Mental models**
- **Human error and automation**
- **Decision making and expertise**
- **Joint cognitive systems**

## Memory and attention

### Memory structures

When trying to describe how the memory works, two types of structures can be noted:

- **Spatial**: memories are stored in a specific location, and *remembering* is a retrieval process involving a specific spatial search through the mind,
- **Parallel distributed processing**: memories stored in the form of connections among units and not stored in a single place.

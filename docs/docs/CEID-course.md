# Cognitive Ergonomics in Design

**COURSE**

---

## Introduction

> The origins of ergonomics relate to ***fitting the task to the person***

Cognitive ergonomics is about considering the impact of how people think, reason, understand
and act in design of all aspects of life, and use it to make better decisions when creating products.

Taking cognitive factors into account can prevent incidents and errors in systems. The example 
of the [**Three Mile Island**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident) incident demontrastes the important of human factors.
In march 1979, bad design and bad user interfaces lead to human errors and then a nuclear incident. It was the most significant accident in
the U.S commercial nuclear power plant history (see chapter **Human error and automation** for more details).

The course is outlined with the following chapters:

- **Memory and attention**
- **Human workload**
- **Situation awareness**
- **Mental models**
- **Human error and automation**
- **Decision making and expertise**
- **Joint cognitive systems**

## Memory and attention

### Memory structures

When trying to describe how the memory works, two types of structures can be noted:

- **Spatial**: memories are stored in a specific location, and *remembering* is a retrieval process involving a specific spatial search through the mind,
- **Parallel distributed processing**: memories stored in the form of connections among units and not stored in a single place.

### Memory models

More precisely, the memory presents many states, components and other elemets that makes it more complex. Psychologist have been
trying to explain it through diverse models for many years. However critized, these models have influenced memory research.

#### Multi-store model

Proposed in 1968 by **Richard Atkinson** and **Richard Siffrin**, the multi-store model (or *modal model*) asserts that the memory is split
in three separate stores: **Sensory**, **Short-term** and **Long-term**.

The sensory stores describes the very brief availibility of memories related to envionmental stimulus. While it is generally
agreed that there is a sensory store for each sense, most of the research in the area has focused on the visual and auditory systems. The **iconic** store
refers to the visual system (delay of ~0.5 seconds, limited to the field of vision) and the **echoic** store focuses on the auditory system (delay of ~2 seconds). Unless attended, most of the information in sensory stores decays and is quickly forgotten.

When sensory memory is attended, it is transferred to the short-term store. This store holds information for a longer duration, but has a
very limited capacity: seven, plus or minus two items. However the short-term memory is susceptible to loss of information when
distracted. The duration can be extended if the information is **rehearsed**.

If that information is rehearsed thoroughly for a longer period of time, it is transferred to the long-term store. This store 
is more or less a permanent store that can hold information over extremely long periods of time. It is in fact assumed to be nearly
limitless in its duration and capacity. Information stored there can be transferred back to the short-term store where it can be
attended to and manipulated.

> **Criticism**: the modal model has been intensively critized over the following aspects:
>
> - Over simplified,
> - Evidence that the short-term probably behaves differently for different senses,
> - Fails to explain how information is really stored in the long-term store,
> - Focuses more on the structure instead of the actual process involved in memory and learning.

#### Working memory model

Proposed in 1974 by **Alan Baddely** and **Graham Hitch** proposed the working memory model in attempt to present a more
accurate model than the modal model by introducing a three part **working memory** replacing the short-term store. In 2000, they 
added a fourth component in the model. These components are:

- **Central executive**: acts as a supervisory system controlling to flow of information from and to its slave systems: the phonological loop and 
the visuo-spatial sketchpad,
- **Phonological loop**: stores information in a phonological form (speech-based, verbal content),
- **Visuo-visual sketch**: stores the spatial and/or visual data,
- **Episodic buffer**: conjoins information from the phonological loop and the visuo-visual sketch (visual, spatial and verbal information) with long-term memory (chronological information) into a single episodic representation (e.g. the memory of a story or a movie scene).

> **Advantages**: 
> 
> - Explains real world memory tasks (e.g. mental arithmetic, verbal reasoning),
> - Explains better the experiences of brain damaged patients,
> - Less focused on verbal rehearsal for retention.
> 
> **Disadvantage**: Difficulty to measure the capacity of the central executive.

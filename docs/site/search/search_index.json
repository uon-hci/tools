Introduction: Simulation Simulation is giving a false impression of.. , reproducing the conditions of.. or looking and acting like.. . In modern life it is the science of make-believe , artificial and virtual constructions. Dimensions It has three different dimensions : Live : Real people using simulated machines in real environment, Virtual : Real people using simulated machines in simulated environment, Constructive : Simulated people using simulated machine in simulated environment. Areas and Industries In modern life, simulation is involved in 5 key application areas: Training and education , Design , Entertainement , Criminal investigations , Research . As well as 7 key industries: Transport , Media , Defense , Emergency services , Healthcare , Manufacturing , Energy . Advantages and Disadvantages The advantages of simulation are: Resource savings : reduced need for real objects, quicker development time, it's not the \"real\" thing, Utility : trying and experimenting easily, target specific user groups, repeat exercises, assess performances easily, maintain control over variables, investigate issues hard to come by in the real world, Safety : reduced potential harm, consider extreme issues (a plane crash), good for novice users. The disadvantages of simulation are: Validity : potential failure to reflect real-world performance/behaviour, Sickness : people getting sick in the simulator, Costs : start-up, maintenance, Software : difficult to use/learn.","title":"SDHM Course"},{"location":"SDHM-course/#simulation-and-digital-human-modeling","text":"COURSE","title":"Simulation and Digital Human modeling"},{"location":"SDHM-course/#1-introduction-simulation","text":"Simulation is giving a false impression of.. , reproducing the conditions of.. or looking and acting like.. .

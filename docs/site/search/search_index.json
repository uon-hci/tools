Taking cognitive factors into account can prevent incidents and errors in systems. The example of the Three Mile Island incident demontrastes the important of human factors. In march 1979, bad design and bad user interfaces lead to human errors and then a nuclear incident. It was the most significant accident in the U.S commercial nuclear power plant history (see chapter Human error and automation for more details). The course is outlined with the following chapters: Memory and attention Human workload Situation awareness Mental models Human error and automation Decision making and expertise Joint cognitive systems Memory and attention Memory structures When trying to describe how the memory works, two types of structures can be noted: Spatial : memories are stored in a specific location, and remembering is a retrieval process involving a specific spatial search through the mind, Parallel distributed processing : memories stored in the form of connections among units and not stored in a single place. Memory models More precisely, the memory presents many states, components and other elemets that makes it more complex. Psychologist have been trying to explain it through diverse models for many years. However critized, these models have influenced memory research. Multi-store model Proposed in 1968 by Richard Atkinson and Richard Siffrin , the multi-store model (or modal model ) asserts that the memory is split in three separate stores: Sensory , Short-term and Long-term . The sensory stores describes the very brief availibility of memories related to envionmental stimulus. While it is generally agreed that there is a sensory store for each sense, most of the research in the area has focused on the visual and auditory systems. The iconic store refers to the visual system (delay of ~0.5 seconds, limited to the field of vision) and the echoic store focuses on the auditory system (delay of ~2 seconds). Unless attended, most of the information in sensory stores decays and is quickly forgotten. When sensory memory is attended, it is transferred to the short-term store. This store holds information for a longer duration, but has a very limited capacity: seven, plus or minus two items. However the short-term memory is susceptible to loss of information when distracted. The duration can be extended if the information is rehearsed . If that information is rehearsed thoroughly for a longer period of time, it is transferred to the long-term store. This store is more or less a permanent store that can hold information over extremely long periods of time. It is in fact assumed to be nearly limitless in its duration and capacity. Information stored there can be transferred back to the short-term store where it can be attended to and manipulated. Criticism : the modal model has been intensively critized over the following aspects: Over simplified, Evidence that the short-term probably behaves differently for different senses, Fails to explain how information is really stored in the long-term store, Focuses more on the structure instead of the actual process involved in memory and learning. Working memory model Proposed in 1974 by Alan Baddely and Graham Hitch proposed the working memory model in attempt to present a more accurate model than the modal model by introducing a three part working memory replacing the short-term store. In 2000, they added a fourth component in the model. These components are: Central executive : acts as a supervisory system controlling to flow of information from and to its slave systems: the phonological loop and the visuo-spatial sketchpad, Phonological loop : stores information in a phonological form (speech-based, verbal content), Visuo-visual sketch : stores the spatial and/or visual data, Episodic buffer : conjoins information from the phonological loop and the visuo-visual sketch (visual, spatial and verbal information) with long-term memory (chronological information) into a single episodic representation (e.g. the memory of a story or a movie scene).

Ethnography comes from the greek ethnos (people) and grapho (study). It dates back to the 18th century (colonialism) as the study of people who lived in faraway places (initially tribal societies) to understand them. The social order is a major concern in ethnography studies to understand the character of everyday life. This course focuses on the empircal aspect of ethnography: the fieldwork . It is the immersion in the field to observe and study but not only from the perspective of an outsider, but from within the midst of everyday life. Also called mucking-in , the goal is to develop an appreciation of people as they really are and apprehend the ordinariness of life. Design Ethnography is relevant to design through computer systems, applications and services that are now embedded in socially organised activities. This social organisation is taken for granted (the mundane interactions: buying a coffee , taking the bus , cooking dinner ). To understand how everyday life gets done, Ethnomethodology is used: it is not a research method, but an analytic orientation . The course is outlined with the following chapters: The focus of fieldwork Doing fieldwork Analytic orientaton to the field Analysing interactional order Representing interactional order Assumptions testing Informing design The focus of fieldwork Ethnometodology is not a method, instead this course focuses on the members's methods used to conduct and organise the social activities, they are called the interactional methods . To describe and understands these methods, the empirical approach of this course requires to collect ethnographic data , or fieldwork data. This data is usually photos, videos, audio recordings or digital prints. Using all this data to give sense to the social order of an activity is also called presenting a praxeological account . In addition to interactional methods, humans make use of a repertoire of interactional resources to achieve social order. These resources are tools, not only drawned from the resource of speech but also from bodily conduct : gaze, body orientation, body motion, gesture. Doing fieldwork For any type of activity, doing fieldwork involves choosing the correct tools and resources to collect data, analyse the member's interactional methods and assemble an ethnographic record . Doing fielwork can be split in three parts: Immersion : witnessing first hand what and how interactions are made (accounts of in and of ), Documentation : recording, transcribing and describing actions and interactions, Examination : identifying what and how interactions are made, providing accounts. Tools and resources Conducting fieldwork can be achieved with the following tools and resources: Notes : writing down observations, thoughts and reflections, snippets of conservations, etc. While observing the activity, it is important to look out for the following details: Ecology : where the action takes place, layout of the space, location of actors and roles, equipments and artefacts used, Formal organisation : plans or procedures, Transitions events : important transition moments (arriving, leaving, etc), Arrangements of collaboration : interactions between members (who talks to whom about what), Audio-visual data indexing : times, sequence, making sense of digital data. Interviews : contextual interviews (not scripted), conversations about the the action conducted while observing it being done, Aduio-visual recordings : video cameras, audio recorders, still photography. Digital logs : messages, social media, conversations, systems, etc. Activity map An activity map is an overview of the phases and activites comprising the activity, it is an index into the ethnographic record of materials to show how each is done in detail. This slicing map the connection between activities, the sequential order, where the action starts, ends, with what, etc. In and of interaction While collecting data and mapping the conduct of an activity answers the question What? , a more thorough work regarding the How? must be done. The accounts of in and of interaction goes beyond the mere description of what is done, but addresses the interactional resources, how digital and physical resources are used, how decisions are made: the aim is to understand what is done in the doing , the members' methods. When studying activities in organisations, it is important to develop an appreciation of working knowledge . This addresses how abstractions are put into practice (plans, procedures, rules, routines, etc) and goes beyond abstract descriptions of method. If one can declare the ability to reproduce an activity in practice , that individual is said to have developed a vulgar competence . Vulgar competence The vulgar competence is an ordinary expertise to understand the ordinary things that people know to do any routine or procedure happen again. It is about recognising what is heard and seen by members of the setting studied, knowing what members' expertise consists of in action. It is about knowing what the members know and describe its methodical character by focusing on their accounts . Members' accounts are the particular things they say , do and the particular way they use resources . It makes what is being done and how it is organised observable-and-reportable . Machinery of interaction The member's accounts provide an accountable interactional order , revealing the machinery of interaction that addresses the taken for granted orderliness of a familiair world. The aim is to transform the simple view of what happened from a matter of particular interaction done by particular people, to a matter of interactions as products of a machinery. This accountable order of interactional work is not person specific, the machinery is the generalisable features of the interaction. Analytic orientation to the field The taken-for-granted orderliness of everyday life When doing analysis of an activity, one must ignore the feeling of normality and obviousness of an social interaction. By finding a scene unremarkable and not worth of analysis, it becomes difficult to notice the accounts (bodily, verbal and artefactual) involved. Analysts must treat everything as anthropologically strange , something they are not familiar with, as if they came from another planet and discovered earth and its inhabitants for the first time, trying to understand everything they say and do. They must proceed with indifference and ignore personal assumptions. Finding the machinery of interaction Finding the acountable interactional order and hence uncovering the machinery of interaction can be done with the following steps: What is being done? : Slice, define, filter and find the order of the accounts as well as their nature (verbal, embodied or artefactual), How is it done? : Elaborate the accounts by describing how what is done is being done, Machinery : Extract a distinctive set of methods for assembling the accounts, that describe Interaction analysis There are specific features of interaction that help unpacking member's methods: Sequentiality Temporal organisation Participation structures Trouble and repair Spatial organisation Tools, artificats and documents . FOCI Sequentiality Sequentiality addresses the context of an interaction, by finding its beginnings, middles and endings. It describes how the interaction is occasioned, or avoided. The goal is to understand how the members recognise and maintain the different phases, how they reach the boundaries or how the transition are managed. The sequentiality can be represented with an activity map. Temporal organisation The temportal orderliness is about orienting the activity to time-tables, deadlines, schedules, calendars, etc. By defining the routines, rythms, repetitions and periodicity of an activity, it is possible to look for the expected and the unexpected, and observe how it is dealt with. Participation structures The participation structures address the extent to which members share a common task orientation and attentional focus. The main aspects in this notion are how do members achieve and maintain a common understanding (embodied interactional resources, i.e pointing , eye-contact ), and the technological resources used to achieve said collaboration. Trouble and repair Trouble defines the notion of a routine feature that occurs frequently, and that although can be subtle, potentially causes misunderstanding if not repaired. Repairing is done through clarifying, repeating, rephrasing, pointing, demonstrating, etc. Spatial organisation The spatial organisation of an activity concerns how the members, resources, tools, artificats and documents are distributed in space. In a social activity, members are co-oriented in space, based on the social norms: personal space , public spaces or private spaces . The spatial configuration of a setting may constrain or enable certain interactions, and elements might get moved around. It is aslo important to address the work involved in preparing the activity, or putting back the setting to its original organisation. Tools, artifacts and documents Resources employed in the interaction, both physical and digital are useful to analyse social organisation. Documents can be used as ordering devices (.i.e shopping list ). Collaborative documents can often be indexical to interaction and demonstrative to how they were produced. Conversation analysis Conversation analysis seeks to describe the underlying social organization through which orderly and intelligible social interaction is made possible. Adjency pairs Talk tends to occur in responsive pairs; however, the pairs may be split over a sequence of turns. Two different speakers, in adjacent positions, are arranged in terms of first and second pair part . Examples can be Question/Answer, Greeting/Response, Invitation/Acceptance-Refusal, Offering/Taking. While adjencent pairing was brought in the context of talk analysis, it is actually the building block of many forms of modalities of interaction. Not only talk, but embodied interaction, physical interaction and digital interaction are of importance in adjacent pairs. Adjacent pairing helps to l ocate the procedural ways in which the work of the setting is ordered. Turn taking Turn taking is an interactional exchange system, used for the ordering of many activities. It addresses embodied resources that members employ to take turn in interaction, such as verbal (talk, intonation, tone, pitch, pacing) and non-verbal (gaze, glance, bodily orientation, gestures, pointing) or the use of artefacts. So how do members know when it's their turn? Turn-taking is plit in two components: Turn-Constructional Units (TCUs): phrases, sentences, clauses, etc, Turn allocation : occurs at transitions through speaker-selection or self-selection . If the current speaker stops or pauses, these behaviors can occur: if the current speaker nominates the next speaker, the latter has to right and is obliged to speak, if the current speaker doesn't nominate the next speaker, other speakers may self-select, or the current speaker can continue. Representing interactional order Representing interactional order consists of: Representing the sequential organisation in an activity map This represents the phases and activities, WHAT is done, also called accounts about interaction Unpacking the world in and through praxeological accounts This represents HOW it is done, also called accounts in and of interaction , Praxeological accounts = Vivid exhibits + Thick description Vivid exhibits : photos, sequences of images, transcripts, Thick description : higlighting the member's methods implicated in the production and recognition of accounts in and of interaction Assembling the collection of members' methods to describe the machinery of interaction","title":"Design Ethnography"},{"location":"DE-course/#design-ethnography","text":"COURSE","title":"Design Ethnography"},{"location":"DE-course/#introduction","text":"Design ethnography is about understanding people in a sociological perspective.

Introduction: Simulation Simulation is giving a false impression of.. , reproducing the conditions of.. or looking and acting like.. . In modern life it is the science of make-believe , artificial and virtual constructions. Dimensions It has three different dimensions : Live : Real people using simulated machines in real environment, Virtual : Real people using simulated machines in simulated environment, Constructive : Simulated people using simulated machine in simulated environment. Areas and Industries In modern life, simulation is involved in 5 key application areas: Training and education , Design , Entertainement , Criminal investigations , Research . As well as 7 key industries: Transport , Media , Defense , Emergency services , Healthcare , Manufacturing , Energy . Advantages and Disadvantages The advantages of simulation are: Resource savings : reduced need for real objects, quicker development time, it's not the \"real\" thing, Utility : trying and experimenting easily, target specific user groups, repeat exercises, assess performances easily, maintain control over variables, investigate issues hard to come by in the real world, Safety : reduced potential harm, consider extreme issues (a plane crash), good for novice users. The disadvantages of simulation are: Validity : potential failure to reflect real-world performance/behaviour, Sickness : people getting sick in the simulator, Costs : start-up, maintenance, Software : difficult to use/learn. 2. Sickness in Simulators Symptoms of sickness Symptoms of sickness during a simulation can be: Eye strain , Headache , Diziness Sweating , Disorientation , Drowsiness/Fatigue , Vertigo , Pallor , Nausea , Vomiting . Importance in understanding sickness Understanding sickness in a simulator is very important for the following reasons: Ethics : subject participants to discomfort, Representativeness of the sample : defining who can/can't use/participate in the simulator and/or the product, Negative transfer of training : sickness implies difficult teaching/learning conditions, Validity of results : sick participants can interfere with practical performance results, Design : a simulator that makes most people sick needs to be redesigned (so is the product). Sensor Conflict Theory During a simulator session, three major spatial senses are challenged: the Visual System , the Vestibular System , the Non-Vestibular System . If these senses are conflicted, sickness is bound to appear. There are two types of conflict: Visual-inertial : conflict between the Visual System and the Vestibular/Non-Vestibular System, Canal-otolith : conflict within the Vestibular System. For most simulations, the Visual-inertial conflict is the main consideration. Measuring sickness Sickness can be observed with three major techniques: Asking participants : using questionnaires such as the Simulation Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ, Kennedy), Observing participants : watch for signs of drowsiness, skin pallor, Measuring participants : measure postural instability and physiological characteristics. 3. Fidelity of Simulation Fidelity is the degree of exactness with which something is copied or reproduced . In simulators, it is the degree to which a model or simulation reproduces the state and behaviour of a real world object or perception of a real world object, feature, condition or standard in a measurable or perceivable manner. Importance of fidelity Fidelity in a simulator is an important aspect for the following reasons: Cost : more fidelity requires more cost, Motivation : more fidelity will improve motivation, performance and general behavior to the simulations. Types of fidelity There are two types of fidelity in a simulator: Physical : accuracy with which the simulation provides input to human senses (visual/audio, inertial), Psychological : replication of the relevant cognitive factors involved. Measuring fidelity Measuring fidelity boils down to making comparisons with reality. There are three major ways to do that: Mathematical modeling : simple and strict, but too subjective and arbitrary, Benefits : a relationship between the quantity of benefits (utility, validity, transfer training..etc) and the fidelity, Theoretical perspectives : the number of common elements between the simulation and the real world ; and the accuracy of the mapping between the task stimuli and the response. 4. Benefits Simulators should provide advantages and benefits such as validity, transfer of training, usability and more. Validity There are 5 types of validity: Face : extent to which a simulation appears to be real, particularly relevant to a participant's motivation, Internal : extent to which changes in a dependent variable can be related to an independent variable, Ecological : extent to which the results can be applied in real-world situations, Absolute : measured derived from the simulator are the same/similar as in the real world, Relative : relative effect of a condition is the same in magnitude and direction as in the real word (more used than absolute). Transfer of Training The transfer of training in a simulator is a very important aspect in novice users training for real world situations. This transfer can be either positive or negative: Positive : after training with the simulator, the person correctly applies the acquired knowledge, skills, and abilities in real word situations, Negative : after training with the simulator, the person does not apply or incorrectly applies the proper knowledge, skills, and abilities in real word situations.","title":"Simulation and Digital Human Modeling"},{"location":"SDHM-course/#simulation-and-digital-human-modeling","text":"COURSE","title":"Simulation and Digital Human modeling"},{"location":"SDHM-course/#1-introduction-simulation","text":"Simulation is giving a false impression of.. , reproducing the conditions of.. or looking and acting like.. .

The aim of this course is to be able to analyse products and workplaces using a range of different methods, to compare and contrast different methodological approaches , to evaluate methods and statistical techniques, to demonstrate the application of specific methods in practical contexts ; in order to solve Human Factors-related problems. Choosing methods The understanding of methods is the core matter of this subject. A method is a \" way of proceeding or doing something \", and in Human Factors, allow for the collection of data. Methods need to be clear , structured and repeatable . The context of the studies in which methods are used define purposes, roles and data that make up for many different methods. It is hence very important to understand the context of these studies, and how it impacts the use of methods. Study types Three study types are observed: Laboratory , Simulation and Field . These types are compared with the following table: Laboratory/Simulation Field Advantages More control Real task Disadvantages Limited scope and accuracy Unplanned events (danger, interruptions) Affecting factors In addition to the study type, there are numerous factors affecting the choice of methods: Amount of participants, Motivation ( research , consultancy ), Location, Objective, Types of desired results, Stakeholders, sponsors and funders. Good methods The choice of a method significantly depends on the context of the study. However it doesn't define the quality of a method. What is a good method? Five requirements define the quality of a method: Validity : does the method measure what it is supposed to measure? Reliability : is the method stable? (consistent over various measurements, between/within researchers), Sensitivity : is the method able to detect effects of interest? (the more sensible the more accurate), Usability : is the method easy to learn and implement? Resources : how expensive and demanding (cost, expertise) is the method? Types of measure When doing a study, the type of measures defines the methods used and the data collected. In most ergonomics works, the following measure types are assessed: Performance : Task achivement, errors, Demands : Task time, physical and mental workload, Behaviour : Body movements, Knowledge : Subjective responses to a test situation, Opinions : Ratings, preferences. Method types A simple classification splits all available methods into three categories : Observation, Self report, Use of archival data. For all methods, the type of output and validity are also differentiated. There is first the matter of objective or subjective validity: Objective : clamining the describe a true and correct reality, independent of those involved in the research process, Subjective : based on data derived from observations of events as they occur, or from interviews. Finally, the data can be split in two categories: Qualitative : data classification of objects based on attributes and properties, Quantitative : data measuread and expressed numerically. Planning and designing studies Defining the problem, aim and hypotheses The first step in designing a study is to clearly define the problem and issues that require investigation, and what will be achived by doing it. This is usually represented by a system of hypotheses , or statements of the predicted outcome . As studies manipulate variables and data, the aim of these hypotheses is to predict, understand and validate the relationships between said variables. Conventionally, there are two types of hypothesis: Experimental , or H1 , that predicts a dependent relationship between variables, Null , or H0 , that states that variables are not dependent (one does not impact the other). Identify the research variables The said variables are split in three categories: Independant variables ( IV ): variables manipulated by the experimented, related to the individual, task, system or environment, Dependant varaibles ( DV ): varaibles being measured in the experiment, not under the control of the experimenter, possibly affected by the IVs, Controlled variables : variables that need to be kept constant during the experiment. Choose the research setting The research setting (previously mentioned as study type ), needs to be considered through the advantages and disadvantages between Laboratory and Field studies, as well as if it is actually possible to implement one based on the nature of the study. The following table describes the key elements for choosing: Field Advantages Disadvantage Realistic Hard to set up Easier to generalise results May take longer Real participants Difficulty to access real participants -- Many uncontrolled variables -- Harder to control variables Laboratory Advantages Disadvantage Easy to set up Artificial Shorter Participants less motivated Easy to control variables May not be able to controll all extraneous variables Easy to perform comparative tests May be expensive Select the participants sample It is important to properly select the sample , the sall group that is representative of the population . This sample must be the most representative of the population possible, in order to make more general statements about the results. There are multiple types of sampling, depending on if the notion of probability accuracy is desired. The three major ones are: Random : selecting random participants, with each particiant having an equal chance of being selected, Systematic : selecting every nth participant, Stratified random : first diving the population into meaningful groups, then selecting randomly. In other situtions, the participants are selected in a more favored way, when the basic selection techniques seen previously are not precise enough and the sample needs to be very specific. The non-probability sample techniques are: Purposive : satisfying the specific needs of a project, Conveniance sampling : nearest, easiest, cheapest, most convenient. Finally, the resources and costs required to mobilize a sample need to be balanced with the potential results, and the confidence that the results will be significant. Defining the experimental design The number and arrangement of the variables is an important part of the study. The aim is to ensure that the IVs are the only systematic difference between the experimental groups, also called the internal validity . It is also important to consider the measurement of the DVs, such as the data is commonly quantitative, easy to collect, valid, reliable, senstive and ethical. Allocate participants to the experimental conditions There are two ways to allocate and distribute the participants across the IVs: Within : every participant completes every experimental condition, Between : different participants are allocated to each experimental condition. Ethics When doing studies with real participants, ethics play an important part in carrying out the experiments. It is required that they should give informed consent , based on sufficient information on the study (goals, duration, instruction, type of data collected, use of data). They should also be ensured protection from harm, privacy and a right to withdraw at any moment. Conducting the study Preparing the experiment Planning an preparing before conducting the study can be a lengthy process, but is necessary. Once designed, piloting the study with trial members allows to make sure everything is in order and as desired. The practical details such as appointements, timescales or idenfication must be thoroughly planned. Finally the various types of equipment required for the experiments must be properly prepared in order to conduct the study with consistency. Analyzing the data Once the data is collected, analyzing it is a complex process. A common way to do so is the following: Transcribe , examine and outline the data using tools such as charts, tables ; observing patterns, distributions and tendencies, Identify the type of data: nominal (categories), ordinal (ordered) or interval (ordered with equal intervals). Statiscally test the data based on the purpose of the study and the experimental design, Draw conclusions . Presenting results and drawing conclusions Results can be represented visually through charts, figures and tables. Descriptive and inferential statistics are also commonly used. Based on the drawn conslusions ( reject , fail to reject ), a wider discussion must be made regarding the strength of the findings, and how they can be generalized to other contexts. Self report methods Questionnaire Questionnaires are good tools to survey large populations , while ensuring a high response rate . It is however a complex method that requires careful planning and proper question wording. Designing a questionnaire implies the following aspects to consider: Planning : as the questionnaire is an indirect method (no face to face), it is crucial to properly plan it to make the most of it, Sampling : thoroughly target the correct sample to optimize the results on the research question, General instructions : clear outline of what is expected from people filling the questionnaire, Question wording : make questions simple, specific, unambiguous, clear, not misleading, Type of response required : clarity on the structuring of responses (open, categories, multiple-choice, rating), Sequencing of questions : intuitive flow on the sequence of questions, Layout : easy of use, clear and appealing, Demographic details : defining what personal information is really needed, Piloting : trials to identify ambiguities, issues and errors, Administration : process to get access to the desired sample (distribution), Data collection : process to collect the completed questionnaires (postage, internet),$ Data entry and screening : conversion from questionnaire to usable data. There are also many factors to take into consideration to make sure people fill the questionnaire appropriately to obtain good data. Generally, people might not be aware of specific aspects of a task (they don't realize everything they do, and how) or not recall certain information about a task (frequency, exposure). The time since exposure may also affect what can be observed as memory could be altered. Finally, observers and participants can have differences in their understanding and perception of certain aspects. Interview Interviews, unlike questionnaires, happen face to face (or through vocal exchange) with a participant. It is a useful tool to collect detailed task related information, and thoroughly collect data with flexibility . However this method requires more time, and can be costly. Interviews are usually targeted to smaller samples . The aspects to consider for an interview are very similar to those for the questionnaires, but from a more practical point of view. Generally, an interview will require different planning regarding the instructions, the administration, and the data collection. Setting up the meeting, the location and the recording is important. It is also essential to prepare for the interaction with the participant, and behave appropriately to make sure the results are optimized. Finally, choosing the right type of interview is crucial. There are four types of interview: Exploratory : free-style in-depth, Structured : each interview is presented with exactly the same questions in the same order (no diversion), Semi-structured : open, allowing new ideas to be brought up during the interview, generally through a framework of themes to be explored, Group : multiple participants at once. Exploratory Exploratory interviews are used to \" probe \" participants and develop concepts by understanding how people think and feel about specific topics. These interviews are \" free-style \" and spontaneous, with minimal intervention from the researcher. Structured A structured interview is the most quantitative type of interview, providing a strong confidence in the results. By asking the exact same questions to every interviewee, a consistency is kept and the risk of diverting is the lowest. Semi-structured Semi-structured interviews address general themes and core questions, but allow for the interview to divert to broader and external contexts. Generally these interviews still require a set of questions regarding certain topics to always ensure a beneficial method. Being less \" accurate \", these interviews are widely used in qualitative research. Group Group interviews gather multiple participants, and sometimes multiple interviewers. The first benefit in doing such an interview is the obvious saving of time by combining participants. Of course a potential issue with this is the lack of depth, and the difficulty to maintain a structured interview. It is hence very important to limit the group interview to a maximum amount of participants and interviewers. The practical aspects must also be considered: group disposition, turn taking and general order. Other interview techniques Critical incident technique : set of procedures used for collecting direct observations of human behavior that have critical significance and meet methodically defined criteria. These observations are used to solve practical problems and develop broad psychological principles. A critical incident can be described as one that makes a contribution, either positively or negatively, to an activity. Critical decision method : retrospective interview method that employs a set of cognitive probes to non-routine incidents that required expert judgment or decision making. Verbal protocol reports : concurrent and retrospective protocol reports used with cognitive tasks, to determine what workers are thinking about during tasks. Eliciting preferences Understanding the way people perceive, compare and prefer systems and products is an essential part of a design process. There are tools and methods used to identify these aspects in diverse contexts. Paired comparisons When comparing multiple systems, the paired comparisons method can be used to rank and identify general user preferences . This method consists in presenting all possible pairs of the system (product) to every participant, in a random sequence. Each time, the participant must indicate which system was preferred between the two. Identifying the pairs For \\(n\\) objects, there are \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot n \\cdot (n - 1)\\) possible pairs. In the example of 4 chairs, there a \\(1/2 * 4 * 3 = 6\\) possible pairs, that can be \\({AB, AC, BD, CB, CD, DA}.\\) Filling the preference matrix The preference matrix represents every pair and how many participants prefered one object to another (\\(x\\) prefered to \\(y\\)). The following preference matrix for the chairs, with 14 participants, is given: A B C D A - 6 8 12 B 8 - 10 14 C 6 4 - 13 D 2 0 1 - Computing the probability matrix To obtain results and identify the most (or least) preferred object, the probability matrix must be computed. From the preference matrix, every item must be divided by the total number of objects \\(n\\), and empty items (same objects) replaced by \\(0.50\\). A B C D A 0.50 0.43 0.57 0.86 B 0.57 0.50 0.71 1.00 C 0.43 0.29 0.50 0.93 D 0.14 0.00 0.07 0.50 \\(\\sum\\) 1.64 1.22 1.85 3.29 Using the last row, the sum of probabilities, the most preferred chaid is \\(D\\), and the least preferred one is \\(B\\). Relative ranking To rank the objects in relative levels, the use of standard scores, or z-scores , is required. To do so, the distance from the mean, here \\(0.50\\) must be extracted and used in the normal distribution table to get the z-score . If an item is above the mean, the z-score is positive, if it is under the mean the z-score is negative, and null otherwise. A B C D A 0.00 -0.18 0.18 1.06 B 0.18 0.00 0.55 4.00 C -0.18 -0.55 0.00 1.48 D -1.08 -4.00 -1.48 0.00 \\(\\bar{z}\\) -0.27 -1.18 -0.19 1.64 The last row, the mean of the z-scores , represents a relative ranking: \\[ B(-1.18) A(-0.27) C(-0.19) D(1.64) \\] Repertory grid The repertory grid is a tool to identify what constructs are important to a person in a system, product, job or establishement. It helps to understand and indivual's interpretation of his or her environment. Using a method of triads , this method compares elements of a topic (better, worse, extremes). These elements are put in a table that represents a person's perception of a certain topic. The data used to rate and rank the elements can be qualitative and quantitative. In practice, the repertory grid is a structured and thorough method , and can be applied to many contexts. Ideally used early in the design process, it might required more time to train the participaints and make sure the results are valid and reliable. Card sorting The technique of card sorting, also called concept sorting , aims to understand how an individual sees the relationships between a set of concepts . By sorting cards (items, elements) into piles, the participant explores the different ways in which concept are similar or different, using diverse system of sorting (categories, ordered hierarchy). Repeated many times, it can demonstrate many views of how knowledge is organised . The results can then be examined and analyzed to reveal relationships between concepts. Observartional methods Observing is an important skill when doing ergonomics work. It is important to understant what should be observed, and how ? What? Observation is first useful to become familiar with a task, get experience of work in a natural situation, a real setting. It is about observing the actions, postures, bahaviours, techniques, reactions and many more aspects of an activity. More than just observing the participants, it also essential to note the task sequences, timings, equipments and diverse resources, and the interactions between people. How? Observing of an activity and collecting data can be done in many ways. An observation session can either be formal or informal , where a formal approach imposes a large amount of structure and direction on what is to be observed, whereas an informal session is less structured and allows the observer considerable freedom in what information is gathered ad how it is recorded. The observation can also be either direct or indirect . A direct observation is when the observer is present during the experiment, in real time. Indirect observation happens by accessing previous recording. The role of the observer is a complex notion that can vary from simple observer to complete participant . While sometimes frowned upon from a scientifical point of view, the observer can decide to become a participant in the experiment. Participant observation presents advantages such as real experience for the observer (subjective experience), but also presents issues such as the analysis, that should already take place while collecting data. Participant observers can either hide the fact that they are carrying out a research ( the complete participant ), or make it clear from the start what is being observed ( the participant as observer ). Other possible roles are the marginal participant , when the observer plays the role of a passive participant in the \"background\", or the observer-as-participant , where the observer does not take part in the activity, but whose status as researcher is known to the participants. Issues Whichever observation scheme is chosen, issues regarding ethics are raised. It is necessary to obtain permission from those who are being observed and recorded. In the context of covert studies (when the participants are not informed), there are obvious and strong ethical objections, that make that kind of activity more and more rare. Another issue the possible lengthy periods of observations necessary, followed by a large amount of information to analyze, requiring sufficient skills in the subject. There might also be practical issues, like getting the right point of view, access to spectific equipement, etc. Finally, the risk of a bias due to participant being aware of the experience and changing their usual methods is high. Collecting data Collecting data during the experiment can be done with the following tools: Notes : writing down observations, thoughts and reflections, snippets of conservations, etc. While observing the activity, it is important to look out for the following details: Ecology : where the action takes place, layout of the space, location of actors and roles, equipments and artefacts used, Formal organisation : plans or procedures, Transitions events : important transition moments (arriving, leaving, etc), Arrangements of collaboration : interactions between members (who talks to whom about what), Audio-visual data indexing : times, sequence, making sense of digital data. Interviews : contextual interviews (not scripted), conversations about the the action conducted while observing it being done, Aduio-visual recordings : video cameras, audio recorders, still photography. Digital logs : messages, social media, conversations, systems, etc. Analysis of work and work systems Analyzing work is another important aspect of doing ergonomics work. But why do we analyze work? It is relevant to understand the existing systems , the task demands, its description, performance and the capabilities of people, to properly design new systems . It provides different ways of looking at work and systems through what must be done ( normative ), what is actually done ( descriptive ) and what could be done ( formative ). Terminology Understanding concepts such as task , goal and operation is the first step towards work analysis: Task : a set of activities occuring about the same time, sharing some common purpose that is recognised by a task performer. Tasks are usually seen as the smallest useful description of a work activity, and can be defined as a goal to be achieved under certain conditions and with certain resources, Goal : a state to be achieved or maintained by an actor at a particular time, a goal is the object or aim of an action, Operation : units of behaviour undertaken in order to achieve a goal, specified in terms of a target system state, Function : a mode of action or activity by which a product fulfills its purpose, Activity : various actions or conduct in a given context, sometimes distinct from the term task . Task analysis A task analysis is a study of what an operator is required to do, in terms of actions and cognitive processes to achieve a system goal. It is about describing activities, concerned with the examination of human performance in systems, both from the perspective of the behaviour of the human and the factors that shape performance. The fundamental components of task analysis are: Clarifying the problem and collecting relevant information, Analazing and representing the information, Defining future use, solutions and outputs. There are multiple forms of task analysis: Data collection methods : observation, critical incident, etc, Task description : representing data in specific formats (chart, hiearichical task analysis (HTA): decomposig a task into goals, sub-goals, operations an plans), Task simulation : computer modelling, computations, walk-throughs, Task behaviour assessment : eventualities, failures, effects, Task requirements evaluation : environment, checklists, surveys.","title":"Studying Human Performance - Methods"},{"location":"SHP-course/#studying-human-performance-methods","text":"COURSE","title":"Studying Human Performance - Methods"},{"location":"SHP-course/#introduction","text":"Ergonomics is the scientific discipline cocerned with the understanding of interactions among humans and other elements of a system, in order to optimise human well-being and overall system performance.

Generally, an interview will require different planning regarding the instructions, the administration, and the data collection. Setting up the meeting, the location and the recording is important. It is also essential to prepare for the interaction with the participant, and behave appropriately to make sure the results are optimized. Finally, choosing the right type of interview is crucial. There are four types of interview: Exploratory : free-style in-depth, Structured : each interview is presented with exactly the same questions in the same order (no diversion), Semi-structured : open, allowing new ideas to be brought up during the interview, generally through a framework of themes to be explored, Group : multiple participants at once.","title":"Interview"},{"location":"SHP-course/#exploratory","text":"Exploratory interviews are used to \" probe \" participants and develop concepts by understanding how people think and feel about specific topics.

The observation can also be either direct or indirect . A direct observation is when the observer is present during the experiment, in real time. Indirect observation happens by accessing previous recording. The role of the observer is a complex notion that can vary from simple observer to complete participant . While sometimes frowned upon from a scientifical point of view, the observer can decide to become a participant in the experiment. Participant observation presents advantages such as real experience for the observer (subjective experience), but also presents issues such as the analysis, that should already take place while collecting data. Participant observers can either hide the fact that they are carrying out a research ( the complete participant ), or make it clear from the start what is being observed ( the participant as observer ).

Measures of central tendency There are three measures of central tendency to take into account: mean , median and mode . The mean is the average of all numbers and is sometimes called the arithmetic mean , and is generally best for interval data. In a sample with \\(n\\) elements such as \\(x_1, x_2,..., x_n\\), the mean noted \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sum of all the values divided by the numbers of items: \\[\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\\] The median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample, commonly thought of as the \" middle \" value. Finding the median in a sample only requires the sample to be ranked (sorted, ordered). The median is best to use with ordinal data . The basic advantage of the median compared to the mean is that it is not skewed so much by extremely large or small values, and so it may give a better idea of a \" typical \" value. The mode of a set of values is the value that appears most often, the most common entry, best measure for categorical data . Normal distribution Definition The normal distribution (also called Gaussian or the bell curve ), is a very common continuous probability distribution. Normal distributions are very important in statistics and are often used to represent real-valued random varaibles whose distributions are not known. The normal distribution is useful because of the central limit theorem stating that averages of samples converge in distribution to the normal, that is, they become normally distributed when the number of observations is sufficiently large. In simpler words, when observing data from large samples, in many cases, the data tends to be around a central value with no bias left or right. This distribution is found in many naturally occurring phenomena such as heights of people , size of objects produced by machines , errors in measurements , blood pressure , marks on a test and many more. The properties of a normal distribution allow to easiliy manipulate variables and compute significant results. A normally distributed sample is a sample with equal measures of central tendecy, that is when \\(mean = median = mode\\). When this is not the case, the data sample is said to be skewed . A sample can be negatively skewed (\\(mean median mode\\)) or positively skewed (\\(mean median mode\\)). It is not appropriate to perform various statistical tests on a skewed sample. When the sample is normally distributed with a perfect symetry, exactly 50% of the values are lower than the mean, and exactly 50% are higher. A normal distribution is noted \\(\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma)\\) with \\(\\mu\\) the mean, \\(\\sigma\\) the standard deviation and \\(\\sigma^2\\) the variance. Standard deviation The standard deviation, note \\(\\sigma\\), is a measure defining how spread out the numbers of a sample are. A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean , while a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over wider range of values . This measure is the square root of the variance . But what is the variance? The variance is defined as the squared differences from the mean . Informally, the variance measures how far a set of numbers are spread out from their average value. For a sample with \\(n\\) values, it is calculated with the following formula: \\[\\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\mu)^2}{n-1}\\] The standard deviation is therefore calculated with: \\[\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\mu)^2}{n-1}}\\] Once the mean and the standard deviation are known, a perfect description of the distribution is given. Generally we find that: Standard scores The standard deviation is a useful tool to generally examine a sample and contextualize values in 1 to 3 standard deviation units from the mean. However, how to know how many standard deviations a specific value is from the mean? To convert a value to a standard deviation value (also called a standard score or z-score ): Substract the mean to the value ( how far from the mean? ), Divided by the standard deviation ( how many standard deviations? ). Hence for a value \\(x\\), the z-score \\(z\\) is: \\[z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\] Doing that operation is called standardizing , or converting a normal distribution into a standard normal distribution . Usually, the entire sample is standardized at once to simplify the calculations by simply looking up standardized pre-computed tables. The table D.

Coursework 1: RESEARCH Motorcycle manufacturer #counter-steering-is-important #highways-are-painful-whatever-the-bike Objective : Improving sports motorbikes physical comfort with the use of a simulator. What defines a comfortable motorbike? : A motorbike that, during and after a prolonged use, does not lead to any form of physical pain or discomfort, and does not affect the general well being of the rider in ways such as chronic pain, back distortion, muscular cramp and many more. What is the population targeted? : Accustomed motorbike riders, familiar with the notion of comfort and discomfort on a bike, capable of judging accordingly to experience in short, medium and long trips with a motorbike as well as general knowledge and interest in the type of motorbike being tested (maximize data). What parts of the bike affect comfort? : The main part of the bike responsible for comfort or discomfort is the seat. The human body is not made for staying still on the same part of the body for prolonged periods of time. Because of decreased supply of blood to the skin, the area that is being compressed for a long time starts to ache (comparison to sub-consciously turn over while sleeping). This principle implies that for a rider to feel comfortable on a motorbike for a long period of time, he needs to be able to move and change positions on the seat. That includes moving forward, backward, widening the legs opening, relieving the weight by pressing the tank..etc. For example, a seat angled forward will push the rider into the lowest spot, always putting pressure on the same parts of his body. Similarly, a seat too soft will seem comfortable at first, but with longer trips the rider might pressure through and hit the plastic base pan of the bike. In addition, the position and size of both the handlebar and the footplate/gears can also affect the rider's comfort. Of course, comfort and discomfort vary a lot from a rider to another one. Weight, size, general morphology, posture and habits will also influence his experience of comfort on a motorbike. Finally, the impact of the vibrations, the road quality, the speed and forces implied in a motorbike experience is significant (suspensions, vibrations suppression). (we consider here that as sports motorcycles, no additional significant weights are added to the rider). What are the relevant aspects for a simulator to achieve comfort evaluation? : If the primary objective is to test the comfort of a bike, the main goal of the simulator is to present the physical configuration of the motorbike being tested (seat, handlebar position, footplate/gears position) with a virtual riding experience entertaining enough to motivate the participant to stay on the bike for a prolonged period of time. That entertaining riding experience does not need to have a high fidelity to the real-world riding, as the goal is only to test the physical comfort of the motorbike (the visual aspect is not indispensable). There are no transfer of training to teach how to ride, or to improve skills, but only a test on the impact of the motorbike on the participant's physical comfort. However, that entertaining-enough riding experience, to last a longer period of time, needs to present minimum sickness effects. In addition, the physical configuration of the motorbike needs to present a very import aspect of riding: the leaning motion. Even with fidelity not being the principal goal, a leaning mechanism is absolutely necessary for any real-world rider to have a minimal replicating experience of a real motorbike. Finally, the leaning motion influences the position of the rider on the motorbike, which influences his comfort. Expecting a rider to test a seat with a motorbike constantly remaining in a straight line would be a complete lack of validity. What resources and materials are necessary? : We assume that manufacturers desire a simulator capable of adapting to any motorcycle model they are designing and/or already selling. A first way to implement such an adaptability is to build a system where an entire motorcycle can be \"locked-in\" and plugged in the rest of the simulator. This implementation raises many issues: compromising an entire motorcycle when most of its parts won't be relevant for the simulation ; every change of model requires to re-do the cabling and sensing systems for the handlebars steering, acceleration grips, and eventually gears if they are integrated to the simulation ; finally it would require that the motorbike is already designed (put together). On the other hand, building a system that only includes the key physical element of a motorbike that actually interact with the rider, will prove more efficient. All cabling/sensing will be definitive, and to change the simulator to a new model would simply require to modify the system's configuration handlebar position, footplate/grip position, gaz tank size/position, and of course a simple replacement of the seat and its position. (additional variables such as weight of the motorcycle, wheel width and more can be manipulated with the motion system and force applied). How can the utility be controlled? : By first targeting experienced riders, the experiment benefit from specific user groups which will maximize and improve the data. Concerning the control over the variables, the key elements of the bike would entirely be configurable to the desired position and setup. As well, software would allow simple manipulation of the force in motion movements (leaning). Of course, the experiment can be repeated as many times as wanted. What is the degree of validity regarding the comfort/discomfort? : Comfort and discomfort vary from the configuration and design of the bike, the characteristics of the rider and the physical impact of driving on the road (vibrations, forces). Regarding the design of the motorbike, the degree of validity is very high as it will present all relevant physical parts of the motorbike. The characteristics of the rider (morphology, physical condition, habits, posture) are entirely identical to the real-world. Finally, the real-world impact of the road can not be represented in any simulator, as it is only a simulator. Only the force of leaning motion and vibrations can be simulated. The overall degree of validity is therefore high, as the design of the motorbike itself is very important in the comfort of the rider. In addition, the important factor of leaning brings more validity as it would allow the rider to be in more diverse and realistic postures. What is the degree of fidelity regarding the general experience of driving? : As the goal of this simulator is not to train, entertain or experiment on driving factors and human behaviors, the fidelity of the general driving experience does not need to be high. To obtain a simulator with such fidelity, cost and technology are aspects to greatly improve: virtual reality, advanced graphics, advanced study of complex driving phenomenons (counter-steering), perfect synchronization to avoid sickness effects, and general software improvements. The fidelity needs to just enough to maintain the participant motivated (entertained, interested and challenged) while avoiding sickness. The fidelity highly relies on how long participants stay on the bike. If they can't stay long enough to test the comfort on extended period of time, fidelity needs to be elevated. What are the costs for such a simulator : Ideally, a first version of the simulator is implemented with only necessary features to offer a basic driving experience with a high validity regarding physical comfort/discomfort. From that version, fidelity has to be improved until the participants are motivated enough to remain longer on the motorbike. Whare are the limitations? : Regarding the comfort/discomfort, this simulator concept lacks the important effect of the road, the suspensions' importance etc. It only takes in account the participant and the motorbike, with basic leaning forces and motion. In addition, the fidelity may be too low on the first versions for prolonged sessions. Aviation museum Objective : Enhance educational impact of museums for the Spitfire plane from WWII flight experience using a simulator. What is the population targeted : No specific population is targeted. This simulator is for the general public: children, adults, elderly, any individual visiting the museum. What is the Spitfire? : Spitfire, also called Supermarine Spitfire, the most widely produced and strategically important British single-seat fighter of World War II. It was designed in response to a 1934 Air Ministry specification calling for a high-performance fighter with an armament of eight wing-mounted 0.303-inch machine guns. It had a stressed-skin aluminum structure and a graceful elliptical wing with a thin airfoil that gave it exceptional performance at high altitudes. It was designed as a short-range, high-performance interceptor aircraft. What elements from the Spitfire are relevant for general public education? : The Spitfire is iconic in the WWII, both for its physical shape that is very famous and the role it played in the war. Educating the general public about how flying with a Spitfire with a simulator implies two aspects: the plane in itself (cockpit, materials, technical elements) and the virtual flying experience (screen, speed, flight simulator, forces). The plane in itself replicated with precision would educated the public on what it felt like to sit in that plane, to have to handle all the different complex commands and gears, while the virtual flying experience would educated people on how it was to actually fly the plane, understand its speed and performance, why it was so useful during the war. What should be integrated into the simulator for maximized education? : If the museum already exposes a model of a Spitfire, it is not necessary to replicate the entire plane, but only the seat and cockpit parts. Generally speaking, the front part of the plane, from pilot seat to nose, is enough for physical fidelity of the plane. While most of the parts of the simulator can use practical and cost-effective materials, the most important part of it is the cockpit. When participants sit inside the plane, they must witness the complexity of the Spitfire cockpit to feel and relate to the pilot's field of view. Of course, among the many elements of the cockpit, only some of them would be actually functional and connected to the simulator. For even more immersion and physical fidelity, no screen to represent the gauges, instead use fake physical gauges. Concerning the nose of the plane and its helices, it is obvious that making them actually turn would be very dangerous to the public. To overcome that problem, a glass could be put to prevent people from reaching to the helices. If possible, turning the helices would really improve fidelity (think of a big fan in front of the plane). Finally, in front of the simulator, a large screen simulating the flight virtually. The cockpit should be able to open/close. The focus here is to really make them feel that they ARE in a spitfire, reproduced but physically recreating a real experience. From this point, there should be a choice between trying the liftoff (complex, requires caution) or be directly set in the air (for younger or older people). A helmet of a pilot should be available for people to really fit in the character of a pilot in the WWII. A question of ethics is raised: should the virtual simulation include elements from the war ? (other planes, explosions etc). For the fidelity, this would greatly improve the educational aspect of the simulator. For younger and fragile it could be different. Once again there should be a mode as option between \"quiet\" (just flying) and \"war\" (explosions, parachutes, storm, attacks).","title":"Simulation and Digital Human Modeling"},{"location":"simulation-and-digital-human-modeling/#simulation-and-digital-human-modeling","text":"","title":"Simulation and Digital Human Modeling"},{"location":"simulation-and-digital-human-modeling/#lecture-19102018","text":"Important : Course work 1 is due Friday 9th November 2018 .

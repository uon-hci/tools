Introduction: Simulation Simulation is giving a false impression of.. , reproducing the conditions of.. or looking and acting like.. . In modern life it is the science of make-believe , artificial and virtual constructions. Dimensions It has three different dimensions : Live : Real people using simulated machines in real environment, Virtual : Real people using simulated machines in simulated environment, Constructive : Simulated people using simulated machine in simulated environment. Areas and Industries In modern life, simulation is involved in 5 key application areas: Training and education , Design , Entertainement , Criminal investigations , Research . As well as 7 key industries: Transport , Media , Defense , Emergency services , Healthcare , Manufacturing , Energy . Advantages and Disadvantages The advantages of simulation are: Resource savings : reduced need for real objects, quicker development time, it's not the \"real\" thing, Utility : trying and experimenting easily, target specific user groups, repeat exercises, assess performances easily, maintain control over variables, investigate issues hard to come by in the real world, Safety : reduced potential harm, consider extreme issues (a plane crash), good for novice users. The disadvantages of simulation are: Validity : potential failure to reflect real-world performance/behaviour, Sickness : people getting sick in the simulator, Costs : start-up, maintenance, Software : difficult to use/learn. 2. Sickness in Simulators Symptoms of sickness Symptoms of sickness during a simulation can be: Eye strain , Headache , Diziness Sweating , Disorientation , Drowsiness/Fatigue , Vertigo , Pallor , Nausea , Vomiting . Importance in understanding sickness Understanding sickness in a simulator is very important for the following reasons: Ethics : subject participants to discomfort, Representativeness of the sample : defining who can/can't use/participate in the simulator and/or the product, Negative transfer of training : sickness implies difficult teaching/learning conditions, Validity of results : sick participants can interfere with practical performance results, Design : a simulator that makes most people sick needs to be redesigned (so is the product). Sensor Conflict Theory During a simulator session, three major spatial senses are challenged: the Visual System , the Vestibular System , the Non-Vestibular System . If these senses are conflicted, sickness is bound to appear. There are two types of conflict: Visual-inertial : conflict between the Visual System and the Vestibular/Non-Vestibular System, Canal-otolith : conflict within the Vestibular System. For most simulations, the Visual-inertial conflict is the main consideration. Measuring sickness Sickness can be observed with three major techniques: Asking participants : using questionnaires such as the Simulation Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ, Kennedy), Observing participants : watch for signs of drowsiness, skin pallor, Measuring participants : measure postural instability and physiological characteristics. 3. Fidelity of Simulation Fidelity is the degree of exactness with which something is copied or reproduced . In simulators, it is the degree to which a model or simulation reproduces the state and behaviour of a real world object or perception of a real world object, feature, condition or standard in a measurable or perceivable manner. Importance of fidelity Fidelity in a simulator is an important aspect for the following reasons: Cost : more fidelity requires more cost, Motivation : more fidelity will improve motivation, performance and general behavior to the simulations. Types of fidelity There are two types of fidelity in a simulator: Physical : accuracy with which the simulation provides input to human senses (visual/audio, inertial), Psychological : replication of the relevant cognitive factors involved. Measuring fidelity Measuring fidelity boils down to making comparisons with reality. There are three major ways to do that: Mathematical modeling : simple and strict, but too subjective and arbitrary, Benefits : a relationship between the quantity of benefits (utility, validity, transfer training..etc) and the fidelity, Theoretical perspectives : the number of common elements between the simulation and the real world ; and the accuracy of the mapping between the task stimuli and the response. 4. Benefits Simulators should provide advantages and benefits such as validity, transfer of training, usability and more. Validity There are 5 types of validity: Face : extent to which a simulation appears to be real, particularly relevant to a participant's motivation, Internal : extent to which changes in a dependent variable can be related to an independent variable, Ecological : extent to which the results can be applied in real-world situations, Absolute : measured derived from the simulator are the same/similar as in the real world, Relative : relative effect of a condition is the same in magnitude and direction as in the real word (more used than absolute). Transfer of Training The transfer of training in a simulator is a very important aspect in novice users training for real world situations. This transfer can be either positive or negative: Positive : after training with the simulator, the person correctly applies the acquired knowledge, skills, and abilities in real word situations, Negative : after training with the simulator, the person does not apply or incorrectly applies the proper knowledge, skills, and abilities in real word situations.","title":"SDHM Course"},{"location":"SDHM-course/#simulation-and-digital-human-modeling","text":"COURSE","title":"Simulation and Digital Human modeling"},{"location":"SDHM-course/#1-introduction-simulation","text":"Simulation is giving a false impression of.. , reproducing the conditions of.. or looking and acting like.. .
